quick and dirty hack to record and playback input events from linux
event devices. `evrec` dumps raw input_event structs to stdout,
modifying their `time` fields to reflect the delta since the last event.
`evplay` does the inverse.

use like:

	$ make
	$ ./build/evrec [input device] > [dump file]
	$ ./build/evplay [input device] < [dump file]

this code is released into the public domain.
